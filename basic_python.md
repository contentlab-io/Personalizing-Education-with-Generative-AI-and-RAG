### What is Python?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. 


### Key Features:

- **Easy to learn:** Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- **Highly readable:** Its clear syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
- **Interpreted language:** Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
- **Extensive Standard Library:** Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks.
- **Dynamic typing:** Python does not require declaring the variable type.

## Basic Syntax:

Here is a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!":

```python
print("Hello, World!") 
```

## Variables and Data Types:
In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. Python has various data types including:

- Integers (int)
- Floating point numbers (float)
- Strings (str)

### Example:

```python
my_int = 10
my_float = 20.5
my_string = "Hello, Python!"
```

## Comments:
Comments in Python start with the hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line.

### Example:

``` python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints Hello, World!
```
